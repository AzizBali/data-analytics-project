## PART 1: FIFA 21 Data Analytics & Visualization
In this part of the project, we used the database of FIFA 21 players to check for correlations between different stats and draw conclusions/insights.

## PART 2: Face Recognition Model of Football Players (8 classes)
The notebook code unzips the dataset (fifa_player_dataset.zip) and splits it into the training and validation sets based on the given ratio (0.8 t / 0.2 v). Transfer Learning has been implemented with the MobileNetV2 model and imagenet weights. The pre-trained model consists of 155 layers and the whole layers of the pretrained model is retrained to get a better accuracy. Image Augmentation has been implemented to avoid the overfitting of the model. The model has been trained for the 30 epochs and the Validation Accuracy of 97% has been yielded.

The dataset will be uploaded shortly to Kaggle and the link will be added here.
