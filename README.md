## PART 1: FIFA 21 Data Analytics & Visualization
In this project, we used the database of FIFA 21 players to check for correlations between different stats and draw conclusions/insights.

## PART 2: Face Recognition Model of Football Players (8 classes)
The code unzips the dataset and splits it into the training and validation sets based on the given ratio. Transfer Learning has been implemented with the MobileNetV2 model and imagenet weights. The pre-trained model consists of 155 layers and the whole layers of the pretrained model is retrained to get a better accuracy. Image Augmentation has been implemented to avoid the overfitting of the model. The model has been trained for the 30 epochs and the Validation Accuracy of 97% has been yielded.
